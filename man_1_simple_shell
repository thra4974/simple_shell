.SH NAME
.B hsh
 - a simple shell replica

.SH SYNOPSIS
command [-o option_name] [command_file [argument ...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Code_As_Ice
is a simple command line interpreter made as a milestone project for Holberton School
.SH INVOCATION

if no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered an interactive shell. An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently.

Upon starting, hsh inspects the first argument (argument 0) as a name of a file from which to read commands. Commands following the shell are treated as additional parameters.

.SH NOTES
Currently, hsh does not support the following:

.B pwd, env, exit, cd, PATH, help, ...

Ctrl-C enabled

.SH KNOWN BUGS

Given the progress, there are no known bugs as of yet.
